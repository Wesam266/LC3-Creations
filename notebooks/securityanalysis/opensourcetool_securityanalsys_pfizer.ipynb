    "This iPython notebook provides value investor-based analysis for [Pfizer, Inc., an American multinational pharmaceutical corporation](http://www.pfizer.com/). Outside of demonstrating one approach to breaking down a company's financials to determine its intrinsic value, this work also demonstrates the utility of modern data analysis tools like [Python](https://www.python.org/), [iPython](http://ipython.org/), Anaconda, and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) (i.e. machine learning tool) to create repeatable analytic workflows.  You can recreate this analysis for any company.  \n",

    "Now, before you read any further, know this:\n",
    "* *I am not a certified financial analyst*\n",
    "* *I do not have (nor am I working on) a degree or certification from one of the world's [top business schools](http://www.topmba.com/mba-rankings/specialization/finance) hanging on my wall; my degree is in Physics*\n",

    "\n",
    "Now,with the disclaimer out of the way, let's cover some of my realities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What I do have is a strong desire to gradually achieve financial independence by acquiring assets at a discount [(if you don't know what an asset is, click here to learn)](http://www.investinganswers.com/financial-dictionary/financial-statement-analysis/asset-2278).  Add to that my insatiable curiosity to learn new and smarter ways of using data to improve my situation (i.e. learn more, grow net worth, or automate something).  In this case, the goal is to purchase assets -- after careful analysis -- at every possible opportunity.  Thus, securities hold a significant portion of my net worth.  More importantly, the analysis I share today is a part of what I do to grow my resources for the future. What's the point? There's no agenda here, outside of sharing a repeatable analytic workflow, helping other value investors along the way, and showing how data analytics impacts nearly every career field. Plain and simple, this exercise will demonstrate how information availability and open source technologies expand the world of possibilities to the common man.  An added benefit is, we'll learn to break down a company like Warren Buffett. \n",

    "\n",
    "Before we delve into the analysis, it's only proper that we address or at least provide resources for some of the terms thrown out so far. Let's start with value investing.  Value investing is the [strategy of selecting stocks that sell for less than their intrinsic values](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueinvesting.asp).  In layman's terms, that translates to \"buying something on sale\".  At the core of value investing is the need to do some financial analysis.  It only make sense; in order to understand that something is selling at a discount you must first understand what it is worth.  So, while value investing involves rigourous analysis of facts and figures, it's still more of an art than a science. \n",
    "\n",
    "The greatest value investing artist of this age is [Warren Buffett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett).  In truth, the greatest \"artist\" is actually a tandem of artists, featuring Warren Buffett and [Charlie Munger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger), but Mr. Buffett is easily the more visible and vocal of the two.  Warren Buffett has left a wealth of knowledge on value investing in letters to [Berkshire Hathaway shareholders](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html), [his autobiography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Snowball:_Warren_Buffett_and_the_Business_of_Life), and dozens of [magazine articles and speeches](http://www.tilsonfunds.com/motley_berkshire_warren_speeches.php) over several decades. In all of that knowledge, and specifically the [1976](https://aboveaverageodds.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/buffett_bh76.pdf) and [1978](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1978.html) letters to shareholders , Mr. Buffett provided four rules that govern his strategy for investing, which we will use in our analysis of a company in the notebook.  Buffett acquires partial ownership of a business when it: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Is a business that he understands.**  *Levine-Weinberg from TheFool.com put it well in his [July 2014 article](http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/07/06/warren-buffetts-4-rules-for-stock-market-success.aspx), \"There are surely tech start-ups you could invest in today that will crush the market in the next 10 years. But if you're not a technology expert, how will you find them?\"  <span style=\"color:red; font-family:Georgia; font-size:initial;\">In this example, I picked Pfizer.  They make discover, develop, and manufacture healthcare products.  Pretty easy to understand.* </span>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ** Has favorable longterm prospects.**  *A good translation is in a [June 2015 BusinessInsider.com article](http://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-investing-rules-2015-6) where Kathleen Elkins said one must consider \"whether or not the company will be able to sell their product in 30 years.\"  <span style=\"color:red; font-family:Georgia; font-size:initial;\">Here is a simple example: Apple is a great company, but will people be using iPhones in 2045 (pretty much an unknown)?  Will people still be drinking Coca Cola in 2045 (that's a near certainty)?*</span>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Operated by honest and competent people** *This rule is simple enough, but hard to measure.  An article at [InvestorsPodcast.com](http://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/episodes/3-warren-buffett-rules-intrinsic-value.html#sthash.ezTVFQpA.dpuf) gives us one measurable, borrowing from BuffettsBooks.com, when it says \"look for a company that has twice as much equity as debt...Having only a little debt gives the business a lot of flexibility and agility to make the right decisions for shareholders.\"  <span style=\"color:red; font-family:Georgia; font-size:initial;\">We will use the debt-to-equity and current ratios to evaluate leadership impact on debt.*</span>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "4. **Available at a very attractive price.** *This is the simplest rule, but the one that requires the most detective work and data analysis. This centers on calculating the intrinsic value of a company, or the true worth of a company (not the ticker price).  <span style=\"color:red; font-family:Georgia; font-size:initial;\">Buffett talked about [the \"art\" of calculating intrincic value in an annual report](http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/03/warren-buffett-intrinsic-value-two-problems/).  For now, I use the [BuffetsBooks.com calculator](http://buffettsbooks.com/howtoinvestinstocks/course2/stocks/intrinsic-value-calculator.html#sthash.I02x9s7w.dpbs).*</span>\n",

    "![BerkshireHathawayLetters](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51duPVN7EnL._SX391_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple rules right?  A company qualifies gets into \"Buffet-worthy\" territory by passing these four rules.  Seems like everyone should be knocking it out of the park like Buffett.  But, it can be hard to find company's that are selling below intrinsic value.  As you will see in this notebook's analysis, more of your time will be spent analyzing and deciding a company is not worth owning.  Buffett covered this in his 1976 shareholder letter when he said, *\"It is difficult to find investments meeting such a test, and that is one reason for our concentration of holdings.  We simply can't find one hundred different securities that conform to our investment requirements.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "One last bit of value investor knowledge before we move to the data analysis.  Purchasing a [share or stock is becoming a part owner of a business](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp). It is more than buying the price tied to a ticker symbol.  Holding that concept in your mind stresses the importance of analyzing the company in the same way you would analyze a person who asks you to borrow some money.  You lend based on their ability to pay you back.  In this case, you invest based on the company's ability to return value over and extended period of time.   "

    "Finally, we have enough data to make the ultimate calculation; the intricsic value.  To do this, we take all the values from the historical financials and plug them into [Buffett Books Intrinsic Value Calculator](http://buffettsbooks.com/howtoinvestinstocks/course2/stocks/intrinsic-value-calculator.html#sthash.I02x9s7w.dpbs).  For every investor, intrinsic values will differ given the use of the current US treasury 10 year yield.  That changes daily; so calculating intrinsic value today or next week will change.  Either way, you set a bar for each stock that you look at, so know when something is 'on sale'.  "
