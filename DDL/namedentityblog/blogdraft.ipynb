    "Named entity extraction is a core subtask of building knowledge from semi/unstructured text sources.  Considering recent increases in computing power and decreases in the costs of data storage, data scientists and developers can build large knowledge bases that contain millions of entities and hundreds of millions of facts about them.  These knowledge bases are key contributors to intelligence computer behavior. Therefore, named entity extraction is at the core of several popular technologies such as smart assistants ([Siri](http://www.apple.com/ios/siri/), [Google Now](https://www.google.com/landing/now/)), machine reading, and deep interpretation of natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a realization of how essential it is to recognize information units like names, including person, organization and location names, and numeric expressions including time, date, money\n",
    "and percent expressions, several questions come to mind.  How do you perform named entity extraction, which is formally called “[Named Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC)](https://benjamins.com/catalog/bct.19)”?  What tools are out there?  How can you evaluate their performance?  And most important, what works with Python (shamelessly exposing my bias)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "This post will survey openly available NERC tools and compare the results against hand labeled data for precision, accuracy, and recall.  The tools and basic information extraction principles in this discussion begin the process of structuring unstructured data.    "

    "### The Data: Peer Reviewed Journals and Keynote Speaker Abstracts from KDD 2015\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in this exercise is to find a good dataset.  Jason Brownlee of www.machinelearningmastery.com had some good suggestions in his [August 2015 article](http://machinelearningmastery.com/practice-machine-learning-with-small-in-memory-datasets-from-the-uci-machine-learning-repository/) on picking a dataset for machine learning exercises:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Real-World**: The datasets should be drawn from the real world (rather than being contrived). This will keep them interesting and introduce the challenges that come with real data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Small**: The datasets need to be small so that you can inspect and understand them and that you can run many models quickly to accelerate your learning cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Well-Understood**: There should be a clear idea of what the data contains, why it was collected, what the problem is that needs to be solved so that you can frame your investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Baseline**: It is also important to have an idea of what algorithms are known to perform well and the scores they achieved so that you have a useful point of comparison. This is important when you are getting started and learning because you need quick feedback as to how well you are performing (close to state-of-the-art or something is broken).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Plentiful**: You need many datasets to choose from, both to satisfy the traits you would like to investigate and (if possible) your natural curiosity and interests. \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, we have a dataset that meets nearly all of these requirements.  In August 2015, I attended the [Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) conference in Sydney, Australia](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2015/).  KDD 2015 attendees received a USB with the conference proceedings.  The repository contains around 250 peer reviewed journal articles and keynote speaker abstracts on data mining, knowledge discovery, big data, data science and their applications. The full conference proceedings can be purchased for \\$60 at the [Association for Computing Machinery's Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/purchase.cfm?id=2783258&CFID=740512201&CFTOKEN=34489585) (includes ACM membership). This post will work with a dataset that is equivalent to the conference proceedings.  The dataset creates a real word data science exercise that is instructive of big data problems.  The goal is to take semi-structured data (PDF journal articles and abstracts in publication format), strip text the files, and add more structure to the data for follow on analysis. \n",
